# Python Practice 🪶
**Python Practice** is a comprehensive, well-organized repository of Python code examples designed for learners to master the language from beginner to advanced levels. It covers core concepts, real-world implementations, and best practices across four major categories: **Basics**, **OOPS**, **Data Structures**, and **Advanced Topics**. Each section contains standalone, executable `.py` files with clear, commented code for hands-on learning and quick reference.

## 🚀 Features
### 🧮 Basics
Foundational Python syntax and programming constructs:
- Variables, data types, operators, and type conversion
- Control flow: `if-elif-else`, loops (`for`, `while`), `break`, `continue`
- Functions, lambda, decorators, generators
- List/dict comprehensions, input handling, modules
- File I/O basics and comments

### ⚙️ OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming)
Complete coverage of Python’s object-oriented paradigm:
- Classes, objects, constructors (`__init__`)
- Encapsulation, inheritance (single & multiple), polymorphism
- Method overriding & overloading (via default args)
- Inner classes, abstraction (`abc` module)
- Special methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.)

### 📦 Data Structures
Practical implementations of core and built-in data structures:
- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Stacks, queues, deque
- Linked lists, trees (basic), graphs (adjacency list)
- Hashing concepts and collision handling

### 🪄 Advanced
Real-world and performance-focused topics:
- Multithreading & multiprocessing
- Locks, semaphores, deadlocks
- File handling (text/binary), context managers (`with`)
- Regular expressions
- Pickling & serialization
- Working with ZIP files and directories

--- 

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Python 3.x** – Core language (no external libraries required)
- **Standard Library** – `threading`, `os`, `pickle`, `re`, `zipfile`, `collections`, etc.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Clone the repo and explore the four main folders: `BASICS`, `OOPS`, `DATA_STRUCTURES`, `ADVANCED`.
2. Each `.py` file is a standalone script with a `main` block — just run it!
3. Code is heavily commented for easy understanding and modification.
4. Use as a quick reference, interview prep, or teaching material.

## 🧪 Setup & Installation
### 📋 Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+ installed
- Any code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, or even IDLE)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Preveen369/Python_Practice.git
cd Python_Practice
```

---

### 🧑‍💻 Steps to run
```bash
# Example: Run a basics script
python "BASICS/intro.py"

# Example: Run an advanced threading demo
python "ADVANCED/multithreading.py"
```
Or simply double-click the `.py` file (Windows) or use your IDE’s Run button.
